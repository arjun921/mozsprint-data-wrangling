# Using Python for Events data analysis

##Purpose  

This is a small test before starting working on something more robust for event growth tracking. I wanted to play with the data generated by the `#mozsprint` hackathon organized by Mozilla Science Lab.

In this short notebook I will keep adding notes on tests I am doing to get insights from these 2 days hackathon
Any contribution is more than welcome

Also if you want to join me on trello I created [a board for this](https://trello.com/b/HXqkPO6U/mozsprint-hackathon)  and I will try to write a blog post about tips for getting ready to take a hackathon :) 

In this notebook I will be doing a lot of data transformation and conversion. I will use classic python libraries like pandas and matplotlib, but also I will introduce some others that are needed for specific purposes like creating a word cloud from a text.
